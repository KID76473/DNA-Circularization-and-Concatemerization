Length of DNA: 2000
Each extension | distance between two adjacent molecules | radius of error:
 1 | 44 | 1
Number of directions: 360
Number of circularization is 7
Number of concatemerization is 6
circularization / concatemerization is 1.1666666666666667
connected / not connect: 4.9591064453125e-05, which should be 4.9173438730118226e-05
average of furthest distance from tail / length = 1414.7629197351584 / 2000
It takes 30.123178958892822 seconds
