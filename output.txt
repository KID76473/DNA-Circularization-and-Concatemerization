Dimension: 3
Length of one axis: 64, and number of molecule: 262144
Length of DNA: 1000
Each extension | distance between two adjacent molecules | radius of error:
 1 | 29 | 1
Number of directions: 360
Number of circularization is 18
Number of concatemerization is 25
circularization / concatemerization is 0.72
Rate of circularization: 6.866455078125e-05
Rate of concatemerization: 9.5367431640625e-05, which should be 0.0001717491576032798
average of furthest distance from tail / length = 705.0637876989404 / 1000
