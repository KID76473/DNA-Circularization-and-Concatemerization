Each extension | distance between two adjacent molecules | radius of error:
 1 | 10 | 1
Number of directions: 360
Number of circularization is 20
Number of concatemerization is 430
circularization / concatemerization is 0.046511627906976744
Rate of circularization: 7.62939453125e-05
Rate of concatemerization: 0.00164031982421875, which should be 0.0041887902047863905
average of furthest distance from tail / length = 705.7557690273406 / 1000
