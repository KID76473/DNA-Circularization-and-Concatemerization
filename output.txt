Dimension: 3
Length of one axis: 64, and number of molecule: 262144
Length of DNA: 1000
Each extension | distance between two adjacent molecules | radius of error:
 1 | 33 | 1
Number of directions: 360
Number of circularization is 30
Number of concatemerization is 10
circularization / concatemerization is 3.0
Rate of circularization: 0.00011444091796875
Rate of concatemerization: 3.814697265625e-05, which should be 0.00011655926217509505
average of furthest distance from tail / length = 704.3663379603198 / 1000
