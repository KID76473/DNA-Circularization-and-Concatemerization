Each extension | distance between two adjacent molecules | radius of error:
 1 | 29 | 1
Number of directions: 360
Number of circularization is 25
Number of concatemerization is 27
circularization / concatemerization is 0.9259259259259259
Rate of circularization: 9.5367431640625e-05
Rate of concatemerization: 0.000102996826171875, which should be 0.0001717491576032798
average of furthest distance from tail / length = 706.1067233032188 / 1000
