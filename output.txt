Dimension: 3
Length of one axis: 32, and number of molecule: 32768
Length of DNA: 10000
Each extension | distance between two adjacent molecules | radius of error:
 1 | 2 | 1
Number of directions: 360
Number of circularization is 0
Number of concatemerization is 4224
circularization / concatemerization is 0.0
Rate of circularization: 0.0
Rate of concatemerization: 0.12890625, which should be 0.7853981633974483
average of furthest distance from tail / length = 7120.852810170737 / 10000
